### Interactive Personal Blog Platform
This APP demostrates DOM manipulation. To run this project go into personal-blog-sba and then run the index.html file in live server. My thought process was first to work on the form component and then the unordered list where I wanted blog cards to display. I made sure that the form validation was working and if the post was valid pushing that into an array that would display blogs. 

Problems I ran into was taking into account the usage of ID numbers of the elements that were already stored in the local storage.
